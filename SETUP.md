# Microgrid IEMS — Detailed Setup & Operations Guide

This document is the long-form companion to `INSTALL.md`. Read `INSTALL.md`
first if you have never deployed this system before; come here when you
need to understand a component in depth, run a non-default ingestion path,
recover from a failure, or onboard a new contributor.

This guide covers four things:

1. **Architecture** — what each container does (twelve if Solar Assistant
   ingestion is enabled) and how they're wired together.
2. **Detailed deployment** — every step from a bare Mac to a fully
   running stack, with a verification at each step and a description
   of what success and failure look like.
3. **Local setup: ingestion alternatives** — three operationally complete
   paths for getting data from the eGauge meter into AnyLog (the
   current Kafka pipeline, a direct MQTT push, and a direct HTTP PUT),
   with rollback procedures for each.
4. **Operations** — daily checks, code updates, disaster recovery,
   troubleshooting reference.
