"""Appliance -> physical-panel mapping for nilm_disaggregated routing.

Corrected for the actual eGauge install (no Shop panel exists):
  * Clothes washer, dryer, water pressure pump, garage refrigerator, garage
    freezer and garage openers are all on Panel 3 (Kitchen).
  * Panel 2 (H2O): water heater, hair dryer, sprinklers, and the master-bath
    mirror incandescent lights (~300 W, the only incandescent load).
  * Panel 1 (HVAC): heat pump (incl. ~550 W fan-only sub-state) and the solar
    water-heater pump. These two are mutually exclusive (interlocked).
  * Jacuzzi pump is never used and is intentionally omitted.
  * Vacuum is mobile (changes panels); routed to Panel 3 for storage.
